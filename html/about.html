                    <p>
                    Based out of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, I am currently attending Dominican University of California 
                    remotely in the <abbr title="Applied Computer Science">ACS</abbr> program, while also working as a Dev Degree Intern at Shopify. 
                    I used to be a Registered Nurse and did most of my work with a not-for-profit that provides comprehensive 
                    health and social services to people experiencing homelessness in Calgary. Prior to my nursing career I 
                    studied some Engineering at the University of Waterloo and completed a Bachelor's of Science in Biology at 
                    the University of Calgary. I have a 5-year old rescue dog who loves to cuddle and bark at any strange noises
                    he hears. Check out an adorable video of him below!
