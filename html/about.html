                    <p>
                        I am based in Calgary, Alberta, where I was born and have lived most of my life. I share my life
                        with my wife and our 5-year old rescue dog, Rocket, who you can see in the video below. When I am
                        not learning about Software I like to meditate, practice yoga, hike, lift weights, play video games,
                        watch movies, read, bake bread, and build things (like the partially finished sauna shown below!)
                        on my family's acerage with my Dad. I am currently playing Stellaris and Doom(2016), and Stellaris has
                        quickly become one of my all-time favourite games.
